Totals graph.... but split up by answer....

- some kind of layered system...
    - As more info is selected, less bars/data is selected per category/demographic selected...


- With one demographic, each bar is different color...
- As soon as more than one demographic is added, each answer becomes color coded (?)

- With age, country, ethnicity, profession, with other demographics present, only top four will be present...
